"# STM 32_Discovery" 

The main idea for this project was to write C code with Keil MDK-ARM-Basic IDE to collect data from an IMU integrated on STM32 Discovery, work with the I/O to signal the changes of orientation by LEDs and later pass the data to Matlab to work on it with direct-cosine-matrix/quaternions and visualise it.
